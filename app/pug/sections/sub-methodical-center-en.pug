							p In my opinion, every design process needs to have prepared „ a good ground“ from the beginning. 

							p Internal brief always helps me to achieve such ground, as well as it answers various questions regarding specific project. 

							p I found as important as internal brief, creating a timetable together with a work structure. I’ve used this system whilst redesigning the web for Methodological centre for museums in nature.

						div.g-s-12.g-m-6.g-xl-6
							p I analysed the whole project with internal brief. This process helped me do define the current problems of the web, and set the goals in form of results, which might have solved those exposed problems. 

							p Whilst working on the brief, I also created the moadboard with successful and less successful reviews, which should be used as base for my further work.

							h4.c-case-study__subtitle The wrong information architecture

							p The main problem was the structure of the content itself. Such content has a key role in webs like this one. Therefore, I needed to start with creation and restructuralisation of the architecture of the content.

							h4.c-case-study__subtitle Obsolete visual <br>& missing responsive design

							p I found the next problem in obsolete visual, which was not attractive to public, as well as there was absence of the responsive version of the web.

							p In the first phases, I worked on the sketches and „low fidelity“ wireframes, which were after subsequent clarification of the information structure elaborated into the detailed drafts. 

							p One of the solutions that I have come to was dividing content part and navigation into two parts. My findings were verified by proto-typing. The tool as inVIsion was used, as well as I experimented with the tool FramerJS, which merit is in animation creation.

						div.g-s-12.g-m-6.g-xl-6
							p Perfection of the product and its design are completed by details. These, at first sight marginal details, create a feeling of control over the product in user as well as feeling, that he can determine what will happen within interaction next. In area of digital design, we talk about so-called "microinteractions".

							p One of my priorities was to improve usability and orientation in web navigation. 

							p Solution was built on division of content and navigational part of the web, and by interaction the goal was to help with filtering out the rust and focus on nature of that exact part. 

							p Solution was tested out within workshop consultations and would be suitable to be tested it out within users as well.

							p One of the issues, which I have mentioned at the beginning, was missing mobile version. 

							p At the times, when approximately every 4th person has access to our web from mobile device, is needed to emphasize this fact. This is one of the reasons why I have attempted to take this in account in my solutions as well.
